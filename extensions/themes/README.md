# Archon Chromium Theme Pack

This directory bundles the Chromium themes that ship with Archon out of the box. Each subfolder is a self-contained theme directory that can be loaded in Chromium-based browsers via **chrome://extensions** (Developer Mode â†’ Load unpacked) or packaged for distribution.

Packaged builds copy these folders into `/usr/share/archon/themes/chromium/` so end users can load them without cloning the repo. During development you can mirror that behavior by running `tools/scripts/export_theme_pack.sh /tmp/archon-themes` (pass `--dry-run` first to preview) to sync the contents into a staging directory.

## Usage

1. Visit `chrome://extensions` (or `brave://extensions`, `edge://extensions`, etc.).
2. Enable **Developer Mode**.
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select any of the directories listed above.
4. The theme will activate immediately.

When creating AUR/packaging artifacts, copy the desired theme folders into the install prefix under `share/archon/themes/chromium/` so they can be offered in the Archon launcher UI. The helper script mentioned above automates this step for local testing.
